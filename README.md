# tailwind-template

A little proof of concept SPA framework I put together in quarantine during the corona pandemic

## Running ⛹️‍♀️

should be able to

```sh
yarn # or npm i
yarn serve # or npm run serve
```

or just open `index.html` in your browser 😊

## Building 👷‍♀️

```sh
yarn build # or npm run build
```

just builds tailwind to not be huge!
